This is a **multi-page HTML project** created as part of my learning journey in web development.  
It covers the **fundamentals of HTML**, including forms, tables, media, and boilerplate structures.  
Each page is designed to demonstrate a different concept.

- **Main Page (`MainPage.html`)** – Homepage with links to all other pages.  
- **Introduction (`Introduction.html`)** – Course introduction and overview of HTML.  
- **HTML Notes (`HTML.html`)** – Covers HTML fundamentals like tags, attributes, and structure.  
- **Tables (`Table.html`)** – Examples of simple and advanced HTML tables.  
- **Boilerplate (`Boilerplate.html`)** – Shows the basic skeleton of an HTML page.  
- **Forms (`Forms.html`)** – Demonstrates input fields, labels, textarea, dropdowns, checkboxes, and submit buttons.  
- **Media (`Media.html`)** – Embeds video, audio, and explains attributes like `controls`, `autoplay`, `poster`, `source`, and `track`.
